\section{What is a Permutation?}
In \emph{The Art of Computer Programming} \cite[p.~45]{Knuth:1997:ACP:260999} Knuth states,
\enquote{A \emph{permutation of \(n\) objects} is an arrangement of \(n\) distinct
objects in a row}. When considering permutations we can consider them as
occuring on the set \(\nrange{n} = \setrange{1}{n}\), therefore a permutation
is a \emph{bijection} \(\pi:\nrange{n} \mapsto \nrange{n}\). A
permutation \(\pi\) can be written in two-line notation
\begin{equation*}
\pi = \twoline{1,2,\dotso,n}{\pi(1),\pi(2),\dotso,\pi(n)}
\end{equation*}
However, the most frequent notation used in computer science is
\emph{one-line notation}, in this form we drop the top line of the two line
notation and are left with the following.
\begin{equation*}
\pi = \perm{\pi(1),\pi(2),\dotso,\pi(n)}
\end{equation*}

\begin{example}
The 6 permutations on \(\nrange{3}\), in one-line notation, are
\begin{equation*}
\perm{1,2,3},\perm{1,3,2},\perm{2,1,3},\perm{2,3,1}, \perm{3,1,2}, \perm{3,2,1}
\end{equation*}
\end{example}

We can display a permutation on a \emph{figure} in order to give a graphical
representation of the permutation. In such a figure we plot the points
\((i,\pi(i))\) in a Cartesian coordinate system. The figure of the permutation
\(\pi = \perm{2,3,1}\) is shown below
\begin{equation*}
    \pattern{}{2,3,1}{}
\end{equation*}
It is convenient to call the elements of the permutation \emph{points} when
referring to these figures.

The set of all permutations of length \(n\) is \(\mathfrak{S}_n\) and
has size \(n!\). The set of all permutations is
\(\mathfrak{S}=\bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty}\mathfrak{S}_i\). Note that \(\mathfrak{S}_0\)
has exactly one element, the empty permutation \(\varepsilon\). As a function
this is equivalent to the unique bijection \(\emptyset \mapsto \emptyset\), and
it's one-line representation is the empty string.

\section{Classical Permutation Patterns}
Classical permutation patterns began to be studied as a result of Knuth's
statements about stack-sorting in \emph{The Art of Computer Programming}
\cite[p.~243, Ex.~5,6]{Knuth:1997:ACP:260999}.

\begin{definition}{(Order isomorphism.)}
    Two substrings \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\dotsm\alpha_n\) and
    \(\beta_1\beta_2\dotsm\beta_n\) are said to be \emph{order isomorphic}
    if they share the same relative order, \ie, \(\alpha_r<\alpha_s\) if and
    only if \(\beta_r<\beta_s\).
\end{definition}

A permutation \(\pi\) is said to \emph{contain} the permutation \(\sigma\) of
length \(k\) as a \emph{pattern} (denoted \(\sigma \preceq \pi\)) if there is some
subsequence \(i_1i_2\dotsm{}i_k\) such that the sequence
\(\pi(i_1)\pi(i_2)\dotsm\pi(i_k)\) is order isomorphic to
\(\sigma(1)\sigma(2)\dotsm\sigma(k)\). If \(\pi\) does not contain
\(\sigma\), we say that \(\pi\) \emph{avoids} \(\sigma\).

For example the permutation \(\pi = \perm{2,4,1,5,3}\) contains the pattern
\(\sigma = \perm{2,3,1}\), since the second, fourth and fifth elements
(\(453\)) are order isomorphic to \(\perm{231}\).
This can be seen graphically below, the subsequence order isomorphic to \(\sigma\)
are highlighted.
\begin{equation*}
    \pattern{2,4,5}{2,4,1,5,3}{}
\end{equation*}

We denote the set of permutations of length \(n\) avoiding a pattern \(\sigma\)
as \(\Av_n(\sigma)\) and \(\av{\sigma} = \bigcup_{i=0}^{\infty}\Av_i(\sigma)\).

Knuth's statements were exercises in showing that the permutations avoiding the
pattern \(\perm{2,3,1}\) are precisely the permutations that are sortable to
the identity permutation using a single stack, and that permutations avoiding the
pattern \(\perm{3,2,1}\) are precisely the permutations that are sortable to
the identity permutation using a single queue with bypass.

\section{Mesh Patterns}
Mesh patterns were introduced by \textcite{journals/combinatorics/BrandenC11} to
capture explicit expansions for certain permutation statistics. They are a
natural extension of classical permutation patterns. A \emph{mesh pattern} is a pair
\begin{equation*}
    p = (\tau,R)\text{ with } \tau \in \mathfrak{S}_k \text{ and } R \subseteq
    [0,k]\times [0,k].
\end{equation*}

The set \(R\) is called the \emph{mesh set} of the mesh pattern \(p\).
The figure for a mesh pattern looks similar to that of a classical pattern with the
addition that we shade the unit square with bottom left corner \((i,j)\) for each \((i,j) \in R\):
\begin{equation*}
    \pattern{}{ 2, 1, 3 }{ 0/1, 0/2, 1/0, 1/1, 2/1, 2/2 }
\end{equation*}

We define containment, and avoidance, of the pattern \(p\) in the permutation
\(\pi\) on mesh patterns analogously to classical containment, and avoidance,
of \(\tau\) in \(\pi\) with the additional restrictions on the relative
position of the occurence of \(\tau\) in \(\pi\). These restrictions say that
no elements of \(\pi\) are allowed in the regions of the figure corresponding
to shaded boxes in the mesh (see \cite[2]{journals/combinatorics/BrandenC11}
for the precise definition).

\begin{example}
    The pattern \(p=\mperm{2,1,3}{\{(0,1),(0,2),(1,0),(1,1),(2,1),(2,2)\}}=
    \textpattern{}{ 2, 1, 3 }{ 0/1, 0/2, 1/0, 1/1, 2/1, 2/2 }\) is contained in
    \(\pi = \perm{3,4,2,1,5}\) but is not contained in \(\sigma = \perm{4,2,3,1,5}\).
\end{example}

Let us consider the figure for the permutation \(\pi\). The subsequence \(325\) is
an occurrence of \(213\) in the classical sense and the remaining points of \(\pi\)
are not contained in the regions corresponding to the shaded boxes in \(p\).
\begin{equation*}
    \pattern{1,3,5}{3,4,2,1,5}{0/2,0/3,0/4,
                               1/0,1/1,1/2,
                               2/0,2/1,2/2,
                               3/2,3/3,3/4,
                               4/2,4/3,4/4}
\end{equation*}
The subsequence \(325\) is therefore an occurence of the pattern \(p\) in \(\pi\) and
\(\pi\) contains \(p\).

Now we consider the figure for the permutation \(\sigma\). This permutation
avoids \(p\) since for every occurence of the classical pattern \(\perm{2,1,3}\)
there is at least one point in one of the shaded boxes. For example, consider the
subsequence\(315\) in \(\sigma\), this is an occurence of \(\perm{2,1,3}\) but
not the mesh pattern since the points with values \(4\) and \(2\) are in the
regions corresponding to the boxes \((0,1)\) and \((0,2)\), which are shaded in
\(p\). This is shown in the figure below.

\begin{equation*}
    \pattern{3,4,5}{4,2,3,1,5}{0/1,0/2,0/3,0/4,
                               1/1,1/2,1/3,1/4,
                               2/1,2/2,2/3,2/4,
                               3/0,3/1,3/2,
                               4/1,4/2,4/3,4/4}
\end{equation*}
This is true for all occurences of \(\perm{2,1,3}\) in \(\sigma\) and
therefore \(\sigma\) avoids \(p\).

We denote the avoidance sets for mesh patterns in the same way as for
classical patterns. Given a mesh pattern \(p=(\sigma,R)\) we say that \(\sigma\) is the \emph{underlying
classical pattern} of \(p\).
\begin{note}
    \label{not:classmesh}
    Classical patterns can be thought of as a subset of mesh patterns: the
    classical pattern \(\pi\) can be represented by a mesh pattern as
    \((\pi,\emptyset)\).
\end{note}

In the past people have studied different classes
of permutations that can be described by mesh patterns. \textcite{babstein2000}
considered \emph{vincular} patterns (also known as \emph{generalised} or \emph{dashed} patterns),
those where two adjacent entries in the pattern must be adjacent in the permutation,
\ie \(R\) is a union of vertical strips.
\textcite{MR2652101} look at classes of pattern where both columns and rows
can be shaded, these are called \emph{bivincular} patterns.
\emph{Bruhat-restricted} patterns were studied by \textcite{MR2264071} in order
to establish necessary conditions for a Schubert variety to be Gorenstein.
Mesh patterns also encompass a subset of \emph{barred} patterns introduced by
\textcite{MR2716312}, those with only one barred letter.

Avoiding pairs of patterns of the same length with certain properties has
also been studied in the past, \textcite{MR2178749} considered avoiding a
pair of vincular patterns of length 3. \textcite{2015arXiv151203226B} study avoiding
a vincular and a covincular pattern simultaneously in order to achieve some
interesting counting results. However, very little work has been done on avoiding
a mesh pattern and a classical pattern simultaneously. In this work we aim to
establish some ground in this field by computing coincidences and Wilf-classes
and calculating some of the enumerations of avoiders of a mesh pattern of length
2 and a classical pattern of length 3.
