# M.Sc. P-rule
Murray Tannock

## Todo
- [ ] Go through set equivalences of $\text{Av}(p,m)$, where $p=132$ and $m$ is any length $2$ mesh pattern.
    - [ ] Cut down equivalences on $m$ using the shading algorithm first.
    - [ ] Try to use P-rule to explain more.
    - [ ] Try to explain any unexplained coincidences.

- [ ] Attempt to extend the P-rule to any general $p$
- [ ] Attempt to extend P-rule to a set of $p$s.
- [ ] Look into the possibility of mesh patterns with the P-rule.

- [ ] Try to hypothesise on sequences of enumerations and try to find bijections to other combinatorial objects (set partitions).
- [ ] Try to explain a hierarchy of set partitions, using hierarchy of mesh patterns.
